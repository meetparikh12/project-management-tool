A Personal Project Management Tool is a web-application created using MERN stack, which is similar as a clone for JIRA / TRELLO.
This project is made for users to manage their projects easily. 
User once authenticated can add new projects as per he/she is working and can also manage project-tasks based on priority (Low/Medium/High) and current status (TO_DO/IN_PROGRESS/DONE) of task.
